<h1>Quiz 2 - About Supporter</h1>
<p>

  1- Implement the ability to display the form and submit a support request as displayed in the wireframe (30%)
<br />
  2- Implement the ability to edit / delete / list all the support requests in a table  (30%)
<br />
  3- Implement the ability to mark a support request as `done` or `undone`.
<br />
   All support requests should default to `undone` which should be listed first. (10%)
<br />
  4- Implement the ability to search support requests (search is wildcard search by name / email / department and message).
<br />
  The search must be case insensitive. (10%)
<br />
  5- Implement the ability to paginate all support requests (7 requests per page). Make your seed file generates 1000 support requests (Hint: consider using the Faker gem to generate data and Kaminari gem to implement pagination). (10%)
<br />
  6- Get the pagination and search to work together. So if you search for a term that has more than 7 results it should paginate within the search results and the search term should still show in the search box (10%)
<br />
  Bonus 1: Write a SQL query that returns a sorted list of the departments and the number of support requests per each department (doesn't have to be inside your Rails app). (10%)
